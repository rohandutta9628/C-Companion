C Companion


A Python built toolbox to simplify and fasten C programming in any IDE and in any platform.
Tired of writing boring lines of code? Or if you are a newbie to the syntax of C Programming Language and facing difficulty to grasp it, this toolbox is the perfect solution. It lets you code faster by automating the boring stuffs like including headers, defining the main function as well as all the fundamentals from creating a variable to taking input and displaying output to the console. Robust syntax of the Decision making statements and the perfect recipe to cook your iteration statement is also included.
What makes it distinct is that it enables introduction to C programming to the school-aged children easily and using click and paste concept they can develop their basic programs and later manoeuvre through the contours of C.
